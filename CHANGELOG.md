and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Shell-aware rules defeat split-token obfuscation (#43).** The command, flag
  and path rules now run against a *deobfuscated* view of each `PKGBUILD` /
  `.install`, parsed with a real shell parser ([`mvdan.cc/sh`](https://github.com/mvdan/sh),
  pure-Go, vendored, never executed). Quote- and encoding-splitting that kept the
  runtime command equal to `sudo` / `curl … | sh` but broke the literal — `s"ud"o`,
  `s''udo`, `su$'\x64'o`, line continuations, `${IFS:0:0}sudo` — is now caught as
  the command it actually runs. ~27 command/flag/path rules were bypassable this
  way; the data-literal rules (URLs, hosts, `\xNN`, `SKIP`) were not and are
  unchanged.
- **`OBF-004` — obfuscated command (token splicing).** Because a PKGBUILD has no
  honest reason to disguise a command name, the splicing itself is now flagged
  **critical**, independently of what the command is: interior quoting (`cu""rl`,
  `/etc/su""doers`), ANSI-C encoding (`su$'\x64'o`), and `${IFS…}` separator
  injection. Ordinary interpolation (`$pkgname-$pkgver`, `--prefix="/usr"`,
  `lib${pkgname}.so`) is deliberately *not* flagged.

### Fixed
- **`PRIV-001` no longer false-positives on echo'd instructions (#43).** A `sudo`
  printed inside an `echo` string (post-install guidance in a `.install` hook) is
  data, not a command, and is no longer flagged — the regex could not tell a
  command position from quoted text, the shell parser can. Reported on
  `un-lock-git`.

### Changed
- **First vendored dependency: `mvdan.cc/sh/v3` (#43).** The shell parser (its
  `syntax`/`fileutil` packages only — pure Go, no cgo) is committed under
  `vendor/`, so the static single-binary build and the hardened release flags are
  unchanged and `go build` stays fully offline. `install.sh` and the `Makefile`
  force `-mod=vendor` when `vendor/` is present. None of the parser's test-only
  modules are compiled in.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Tunable temperature and token budget for local models.** The OpenAI-
  compatible backend accepts `temperature` and `max_tokens` per backend
  (`llmN.conf`) and via `AURSCAN_OPENAI_TEMPERATURE` / `AURSCAN_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS`.
  Reasoning models such as Gemma need `temperature=1.0` and a larger budget — with
  the old fixed 2000-token cap they spent it all on hidden reasoning and returned
  empty `content` with `finish_reason=length`, which now produces an actionable
  error instead of a silent empty verdict.
- **Startup env file (#42).** `~/.config/aurscan/env` is loaded at startup so a
  GUI or launcher can manage LLM configuration in one place. (PR by musqz)

### Changed
- **paru parity in messages (#48, #49).** Usage text and error messages mention
  `paru` alongside `yay`, and `--uninstall-yay-hook` / `--uninstall-paru-hook`
  now appear in `--help`. (PRs by HaleTom)

### Fixed
- **`syay` refresh/print/help edge cases (#37).** `-Sy`, `-Sp` and `-Sh` are
  classified as non-build, so the editor gate is not injected for them. (PR by musqz)
- **`yay -Qua` real errors no longer masked (#38).** An exit 1 with output on
  stderr is treated as a genuine failure rather than "no pending updates", so a
  real error is surfaced instead of silently reported as up-to-date. (PR by musqz)

## [0.6.3] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Source-provenance signals (#40).** The auditor cannot browse to confirm a
  URL belongs to a project, so a plausible but attacker-controlled source no
  longer passes on looks alone. Two offline rules flag downloads whose provenance
  the host cannot establish: `SRC-002` for generic object-storage / file hosts
  where the bucket, path or subdomain is attacker-choosable
  (`storage.googleapis.com`, `*.s3.amazonaws.com`, `*.r2.dev`, `*.pages.dev`,
  `transfer.sh`, …), and `SRC-003` for a download host that matches neither the
  package's stated upstream (`url=`) nor a known forge — both across `source=()`
  and `curl`/`wget` in `build()`/`package()`. The auditor prompt now treats
  unverifiable provenance as a risk and leans `SUSPICIOUS` rather than guessing `OK`.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- Release CI now signs `SHA256SUMS` correctly in GitHub Actions (re-tag of the
  0.6.1 signing fix).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed
- Fix GPG signing of the release `SHA256SUMS` in the GitHub Actions workflow.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added
- **Backend fallback chain (#7, #35).** aurscan tries every configured backend —
  environment-detected first, then `~/.config/aurscan/llm1.conf … llmN.conf` in
  numeric order — before failing closed, instead of giving up on the first. A
  rate-limited or dead primary transparently falls through to the next. The first
  *genuine* verdict wins; only an exhausted chain falls closed to `SUSPICIOUS`.
  Behaviour is unchanged for a single healthy backend. (PR #36 by GeorgelPreput)
- **Degraded-scan awareness on the build hooks.** A verdict produced by a
  *fallback* backend is flagged and annotated; on the unattended build-hook path a
  fallback-produced `OK` requires explicit confirmation on a TTY and fails closed
  without one, closing the path where forcing the primary to fail could route
  approval to a weaker model. The standalone CLI stays lenient.
- **Unicode-abuse detection.** Static rules flag bidirectional control and
  zero-width/BOM characters (Trojan Source, CVE-2021-42574), punycode (`xn--`)
  hosts, and non-ASCII characters in source URLs (homoglyph host impersonation);
  the auditor prompt reasons about look-alike hosts and percent-encoded control
  characters too.

### Security
- **Hardened release binaries (#30).** Release artifacts are PIE with full RELRO,
  built as static-PIE via the external linker with `netgo,osusergo` so they stay
  fully static and portable. UPX was dropped (it stripped PIE/RELRO, tripped AV,
  and hurt reproducibility). Downstream `-bin` packages pass `namcap` cleanly.
- **Signed release checksums (#31).** Release CI publishes `SHA256SUMS` and a
  detached `SHA256SUMS.asc`, signed with the release-tag key, so binaries can be
  verified independently of GitHub transport.

### Fixed
- **Coloured output on the paru hook path (#34).** Colour is re-enabled against
  the controlling terminal when paru runs the hook with stdout redirected; a
  `FORCE_COLOR` escape hatch was added. The "no colour with Codex" report was the
  paru path, not the backend. (reported by HaleTom)
- **`syay` is operation-aware (#27).** Non-build yay operations pass straight
  through; the editor gate is injected only when yay actually builds a package,
  making `alias yay=syay` a safe drop-in. (PR by musqz)
- **`yay -Qua` exit 1 handled (#26).** Exit 1 meaning "no pending AUR updates" is
  treated as empty rather than an error, so `--update-check` / `--gen-file` no
  longer fail on an up-to-date system. (PR by musqz)

## [0.5.2] - 2026-06-21

### Changed
- `install.sh` advertises the native hooks and gives a version-aware yay hint
  (`--install-yay-hook` for yay v13+, the `syay` alias for older yay).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- Warn when an old wrapper alias is made redundant by `--install-yay-hook` /
  `--install-paru-hook`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Native yay v13 integration.** `aurscan --install-yay-hook` registers an
  `AURPostDownload` Lua hook in `~/.config/yay/init.lua`, so plain `yay` (v13+)
  scans every AUR package after `makepkg --verifysource` and before build. Remove
  with `--uninstall-yay-hook`; for yay < 13 keep using `syay`.

### Changed
- The OpenAI-compatible backend omits the `model` field when
  `AURSCAN_OPENAI_MODEL` is unset, so a routing proxy (LiteLLM, …) can pick the
  model. Set it to pin a specific model. (PR #22 by magillos)

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- API key for the OpenAI-compatible backend via `AURSCAN_OPENAI_API_KEY` /
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`, for proxies like LiteLLM (#13).

### Fixed
- **paru interactive build gate (#3).** The `--prebuild` hook prompts over
  `/dev/tty` so a flagged package can be aborted or overridden even though paru
  runs `PreBuildCommand` with redirected stdio; with no terminal it fails closed.
  `--install-paru-hook` writes the user config and `Include`s `/etc/paru.conf`
  instead of shadowing it. (reported by Xaero252, rynti)
- Flush buffered terminal input before the confirmation prompt.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed
- Claude Code CLI backend now parses the array/streaming `--output-format json`
  shape emitted by newer CLIs (v2.1.x), not only the single-object envelope.
  This resolves the "malformed JSON (fail-closed)" seen on the Claude
  subscription backend (#17): the parser walks the record array, takes the final
  `result`, and surfaces an `authentication_failed`/401 record under `--debug`.


## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- **`--score` for script integration (#18).** Scans a single target and exits
  with a 0-100 trust score (MALICIOUS 0-33, SUSPICIOUS 34-66, OK 67-100; higher
  is safer), or 255 if the scan could not be completed. The score is printed to
  stdout and the verdict to stderr for clean capture.
- **Single PKGBUILD by filename or STDIN (#18).** `--score` (and the scanner
  generally) accept a regular file path or `-` to read a PKGBUILD from stdin,
  in addition to directories.
- **`--debug` LLM tracing (#17).** Prints the selected backend, the request
  payload sent to the model, the raw response, and the reason any JSON parse
  failed — diagnosing the "malformed JSON" case reported on the Claude
  subscription backend.

### Changed
- In-app security reports now draft to `aurscan@manticore-projects.com` for
  aggregation/triage instead of the Arch aur-general list. Still never sent
  automatically.
- `scan.Result` gained a `Failed` flag distinguishing an operational failure
  (backend/comms error, unparseable output) from a genuine low-trust verdict.
 
## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-14
 
### Added
- **paru support.** Integrates via paru's native `PreBuildCommand` hook, which
  runs once per package before build (covering `-S`, bare interactive search,
  `-Syu`, AUR dependencies, and cached builds). Two ways to enable:
  `aurscan --install-paru-hook` (no wrapper; one line in `paru.conf`, undo with
  `--uninstall-paru-hook`) or the `sparu` wrapper, symmetric with `syay`, which
  injects an ephemeral `PARU_CONF` that `Include`s the user's real config so it
  is preserved and never modified.
- `aurscan --prebuild <dir>` gate entrypoint (non-interactive, fail-closed, no
  editor chaining) used by the paru hook.
- `sparu` symlink installed alongside `syay`/`aurscan-edit`.
- **Codex CLI backend.** `AURSCAN_BACKEND=codex` runs the scan through the
  `codex` CLI (read-only sandbox, ephemeral, rules ignored); model selectable
  via `AURSCAN_CODEX_MODEL`. Auto-detected after `claude` when present.
- OpenAI-compatible requests now send `response_format: json_object` so servers
  that honor it return strict JSON.
### Changed
- Factored the verdict/usage printer so the interactive gate and the
  non-interactive `Decide` path share output formatting.


## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-15

### Changed
- avoid some false positives as shown in issue #10


## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- `AURSCAN_TIMEOUT` (whole seconds) overrides the per-request LLM budget, which
  was previously a hard-coded 180&nbsp;s. Slow CPU-only local backends (e.g.
  Ollama on a handheld) routinely need longer to process a large prompt and
  generate a verdict (#8).

### Changed
- A request deadline now produces actionable guidance ("model did not respond
  within Ns; raise AURSCAN_TIMEOUT…") instead of the opaque
  `context deadline exceeded`.
- Each OpenAI-compatible URL in a primary/fallback pair gets its own full
  timeout budget, so a stalled primary no longer starves the fallback.
- The local-model request now sends `max_tokens`, bounding generation time on
  local servers the same way the direct-API backend already did.

### Documentation
- New "Choosing a local model" section (#1): a size-vs-suitability table (why
  ≤3B is unusable, 7–8B marginal, 14B the usable minimum, 32B the sweet spot,
  70B+ best), VRAM rules of thumb, and the two settings users most often get
  wrong — `num_ctx` (Ollama's 2048 default silently truncates the package out
  of the prompt) and `AURSCAN_TIMEOUT` on slow CPU-only hosts.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-14

### Changed
- Updated the auditor prompt and static-rule catalog to reflect the June 2026
  **Atomic Arch** campaign (1,500+ hijacked packages): npm `atomic-lockfile` and
  bun `js-digest`/`lockfile-js` payloads, the `src/hooks/deps` bundled stealer,
  eBPF-rootkit artifacts (`/sys/fs/bpf/hidden*`, `CAP_BPF`), paste/temp-host
  exfiltration, and user-mode + `Restart=always` systemd persistence.
- Reputation guidance now warns that the maintainer field cannot be trusted at
  face value, since attackers used git commit forgery to impersonate a
  legitimate maintainer; verdicts judge build-script behaviour over author name.

### Added
- Static rules `NPM-003` (stealer hook path), `BPF-001` (eBPF rootkit artifact),
  `EXFIL-004` (paste/temp-host upload); broadened `PERSIST-001`.
- `testdata/atomicarch-bin` wave-2 fixture (bun/js-digest, structure only).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- Git-stamped `--version` / `-v` (also `syay --version`), printing version,
  commit, build date and Go/OS/arch. Resolution falls back through
  ldflags-stamped values → Go's embedded VCS buildinfo → a `dev` default, so
  the version is meaningful for AUR builds (no `.git`), `go install …@latest`,
  and local `go build` alike.

### Changed
- `Makefile`, `install.sh` and the AUR `PKGBUILD` now stamp version metadata via
  `-ldflags -X`. The PKGBUILD derives it from `$pkgver-$pkgrel` since release
  tarballs carry no `.git`; `git` added to `makedepends`.
- CI checks out full history (`fetch-depth: 0`), stamps release binaries with
  the tag version, and verifies the stamp before packaging.
- `install.sh` reports the built version on install.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Static-rule pre-filter** (`internal/rules`): an offline, zero-cost regex
  catalog adapted from [KiefStudioMA/ks-aur-scanner] (GPL-3.0), with compatible
  codes (DLE-001, PERSIST-006, NPM-001/002, …). Runs before any model call; hits
  are fed to the model as context.
- **Local / self-hosted LLM backend** (`openai`): any OpenAI-compatible
  `/chat/completions` endpoint (llama.cpp, Ollama, vLLM) with primary→fallback
  failover and a swappable model. Generalises the community connector from
  [issue #1].
- **Configurable auditor instructions**: an optional file
  (`~/.config/aurscan/instructions.md` or `AURSCAN_INSTRUCTIONS`) appended to the
  built-in prompt; example at `packaging/instructions.example.md`.
- **Reputation signals**: AUR votes, popularity and orphan/maintainer status are
  passed to the model, which now weights low-popularity packages, recent
  maintainer changes, and changes with no obvious technical reason far more
  heavily.
- `--rules-only` flag (and `AURSCAN_RULES_ONLY`) for a free, fully-offline scan.
- Two-stage pipeline (`internal/pipeline`) with a deterministic rules-only
  verdict when no LLM backend is configured.

### Fixed
- Static-rule false positives: `sudo` vs `build()` declaration, and a browser
  profile rule matching `mozilla.org` in a homepage URL.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- Initial release: a Claude-backed PKGBUILD/`.install` auditor that scans AUR
  packages **before `makepkg` runs**, with a fail-closed, prompt-injection-hardened
  JSON verdict contract.
- `syay` wrapper that gates builds via yay's editor step (a pacman hook fires
  too late, after `makepkg`), covering `-S`, bare search-install and `-Syu`,
  plus AUR dependencies.
- Backends: Claude Code CLI (no API key, exact cost), `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  (exact tokens), and a custom command backend.
- Per-package and session token/cost reporting.
- Interactive gate (abort / report-to-mailing-list / typed override),
  in-memory AUR snapshot fetching, recursive AUR-dependency scanning.
- Makefile, installer with update/uninstall, AUR `PKGBUILD`, and CI that
  attaches UPX-packed release artifacts on tags.
